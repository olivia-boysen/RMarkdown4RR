# Material for: [Reproducible Research in R](https://reproducibleresearchinr.netlify.com/)

#### Delivered at <span style="color:#5E2A43">**Institute of Philosophy and Social Theory**</span> | **University of Beograde**


We have all experienced seeing others presenting their research as either a slideshow presentation, blog post, book or journal article. Looking at the figures and tables without being able to run computational experiments to probe the results presented, effectively limits the scope for understanding the magnitude of the available knowledge within scientific studies. Allowing others to replicate, test, reuse, extend and build on published research results can accelerate the rate in which scientific development drives cultural and technical innovation.  Adopting and applying open and transparent approaches to research is integral to genuinely rigorous analysis and adds to the material value of one’s research. In view of this, the presentation of the available code, data and algorithms should be available to scrutiny and possible connectivity to wider research projects.

This workshop introduces you to open source software  [**R**](https://www.r-project.org) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com) that could serve as a tool for reproducible research. **R** has become essential in the research itself and in communicating its results to the community at large. It is free public domain software that is available to anyone with a desire to discover, learn, explore, experience, expand and share the algorithms of their research science journey. You can learn how to use [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) IDE for **R** from its installation to RStudio customisation and files navigation. RStudio supports working with [Git](https://git-scm.com), an open source distributed version control system, which is easy to use when combined with GitHub, a web-based Git repository hosting service. It introduces GitHub and how to become acquainted with good practice when incorporating the use of Git into an **R** project workflow. 

It shows how to turn a research analyses into high quality documents and presentations with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). It teaches how to designing reproducible reports by automating the reporting process. With the knowledge from this workshop you can create reports straight from your **R** code allowing you to document the analysis and its results as an HTML, pdf, slideshow or Microsoft Word document.

By presenting some simple, but informative examples we illustrate how reproducible research can become common practice for researchers when using a simple and freely available tool.

## Objectives:

-	Understand the motivation for documenting, sharing, automating, organising and disseminating the files in making a research reproducible
-	Introduce the open source tools R/RStudio/RMarkdown/GitHub that can address these problems

## How the course works

The material is structured within 2 modules. Each module is delivered in an hour and forty minutes long hands-on interactive student/teacher session with two then minutes breaks and the last twenty minutes reserved for questions and discussions.

Each module is taught by [Dr Tatjana Kecojevic](tanjakec.github.io) and covers various related topics through appropriate case studies, presentations and readings. The conceptual models come to life when practice becomes reality during the hands-on taught sessions, through the application of **R**. Students are then expected to use their own time to practice and hone acquired expertise during the taught sessions.

Students are expected to participate fully in all of these delivery modes.

## Who can enrol

This workshop will benefit anyone who wants to discover effective and attractive ways to communicate their research outcomes.

Prior experience is not required.
